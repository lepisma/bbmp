## 18th May 2025
Participants: Ankit, Manas, Vivitsa, Prabhsharan, and Abhinav

Our first meetup (physical). We had some discussions around people's interest areas within Mathematics and how we want to take this forward. Additionally Manas took a session on [Ramsey's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem).
