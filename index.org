Participants: @Ankit, @Manas, @Vivitsa, @Prabhsharan, and @Abhinav

Our first meetup (physical). We had some discussions around people's interest
areas within Mathematics and how we want to take this forward. Additionally
Manas took a session on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem][Ramsey's theorem]].

*** From the Whiteboard

*** Links
Here are a few links that were shared in and around the discussion:

1. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1229612.Mathematical_Circles][Mathematical Circles]]
2. [[https://mathoverflow.net/questions/2842/infinite-ramsey-theorem-with-infinitely-many-colours][Infinite Ramsey theorem with infinitely many colours]]

* Resources
Here we collect a few motivational reads for different areas in Mathematics that
some of us mentioned in our meetups. These are less theory heavy and have more
pop-maths feel to them:
