We discussed Euler's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for $n = 3$ and formulation
for generating Pythagorean Triples ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$) from coprimes.

We discussed a few resources that people are studying. Also discussed a little
bit of Modular forms and FLT.

Our first meetup (physical). We had some discussions around people's interest
areas within Mathematics and how we want to take this forward. Additionally
Manas took a session on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem][Ramsey's theorem]].

* Resources
Here we collect a few motivational reads for different areas in Mathematics that
some of us mentioned in our meetups. These are less theory heavy and have more
pop-maths feel to them:
