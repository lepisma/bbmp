We discussed theorem provers like Lean and a plan to make a simple prover that
could work for basic numerical proofs for the purpose of learning.

Our first meetup (physical). We had some discussions around people's interest
areas within Mathematics and how we want to take this forward. Additionally
Manas took a session on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem][Ramsey's theorem]].

Here we collect a few motivational reads for different areas in Mathematics that
some of us mentioned in our meetups. These are less theory heavy and have more
pop-maths feel to them:
