Physical meetup. We discussed a few resources that people are studying. Also
discussed a little bit of Modular forms and FLT.

Our first meetup (physical). We had some discussions around people's interest
areas within Mathematics and how we want to take this forward. Additionally
Manas took a session on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem][Ramsey's theorem]].

*** Links
Here are a few links that were shared in and around the discussion:

2. [[https://mathoverflow.net/questions/2842/infinite-ramsey-theorem-with-infinitely-many-colours][Infinite Ramsey theorem with infinitely many colours]]

* Resources
Here we collect a few motivational reads for different areas in Mathematics that
some of us mentioned in our meetups. These are less theory heavy and have more
pop-maths feel to them:
